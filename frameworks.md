### MVC - Model, View, Controller

Back in internet olden times (1998-2006), the easiest and most common way to create an application on the web was to use the PHP programming language. PHP served as the glue between the markup and the database,, and worked as the "application logic"â€”the part of a web application that uses programming to make something interesting happen. This paradigm, in which persistent data, a visual template, and programming logic are combined to create an application, is known as model-view-controller architecture. 

With PHP, the application logic is embedded inside HTML markup. Most web frameworks, on the other hand, do things the other way around, generating HTML in the application logic. 

### So what is a web framework?

A web framework is software that allows you to create a web application. It takes care of many of the more annoying aspects of creating a dynamic site, such as talking to the server and the database and generating the HTML that users will see.

Most web frameworks are conscious of the model, view, controller paradigm. Inthe next section, we're going to use Flask, a web framework written in Python, to create and serve up a simple view that we can see in our browser. 

### What happened to PHP?

PHP is still going strong, and you can still use it to create web applications. Facebook was written in PHP, as were WordPress and Drupal. As a programming language, however, PHP has some unresolved problems, and frameworks in scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, and Javascript are becoming increasingly popular.
