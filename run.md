### Cloning and Running

Clone this repository to your local machine with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/smythp/intro-to-flask.git
```

In the repository, you'll see a folder named "Chirper." This contains the various stages of the application we will be building. 

When you move into one of the folders in the Chirper folder, you can run the Flask application by typing

```
python run.py
```

in the terminal. You'll need the Flask package to run the examples, but this comes with Anaconda by default.
